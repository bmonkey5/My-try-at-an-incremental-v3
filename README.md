5/7 - Finally uploaded all the changes, changed how everything behind the scenes work, to make it more snappy. Remade everything into
      objects, redone deathstate. Now with saving and loading too, that took a while to learn, next step: rng items, you know it!

4/21 - Fixed attack speed, fixed armor healing you ( that was stoopid) , added a death state.
